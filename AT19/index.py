# dynamic language?
# dont have to use datatype while declaring a variable
# DT assign based on the type of value of variable

# variable?
# a location in memory which going to hold the value
# ex: a = 178

# Datatype?
# describe type of data assign to a variable
# types:
#     pre defined -> int, str (collection of character), char(single alphabet), boolean, long, double, float and decimal
#     user defined -> class

# input

# inp = input("Enter your name")
# print(inp)

# function => set of instructions that can be reused.
# purpose => reduce duplication, increase code readability

# type casting
# -------------
# to find out a type of variable we can type(<variable_name>)
# a = int("15")
# print(a)
# 10  => "10"

# condition stmt
# age = input('Enter your age ')
# age = int(age)
# if (age > 18 and age <= 100):
#     print("Eligible")
# elif (age > 100):
#     print("Invalid age")
# else:
#     print("not eligible")

# loops
# while
#     do while
# for

# a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
# for _ in range(10):  # [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,9]
#     print(2)
