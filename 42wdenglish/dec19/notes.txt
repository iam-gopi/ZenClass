sync -> always in sync
async -> no wait, that latest execution i s called as callback
callback - pass a function as arguement to anther function ex: settimeout

thread present within a process 

paging, context switching - not mandatory 

thread -> is a light weight process

node js -> is a single threaded 
event loop - which helps me to achieve async behaviour in js code with the help of brower api  Q and event Q
